## These are the ipynb for cropping Tibetan books
Each ipynb file corresponds to a book, because the images scaned from different books have different noises.

The cropped results are in this folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eDwHyiNaMLggn0giA-5hP7X61i0ppHbj

Please contact @tianrengao and @BohanZhai if you have any questions.
